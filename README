Snowstorm: A Javascript Snow Effect for HTML

Bringing snow to the web since 2003.

So, you want Javascript snow on your web site, eh?

Snowstorm is a Javascript-driven snow effect that can be easily added to web pages. It is free for use, and easy to set up. A single Javascript file provides the functionality required. No images are used for the snow effect.

What kind of things can I customize?

You can adjust the snow speed, the amount of snow, the "wind", if and where it should stick (and if it should "melt"), and finally, whether the snow can react to the mouse moving (ie., "wind changes.")
